# Implied Probability Density Functions the Structural Dynamics of Option-Imp lied Probability Distributions (IVPDF)
Overview

This project investigates the structural dynamics of option-implied probability distributions (IVPDFs), also known as risk-neutral densities (RNDs). These distributions represent the market’s forward-looking expectations of asset prices and contain valuable information on variance, skewness, and kurtosis, which map directly to perceived risk and tail-event probabilities.

By extracting and analyzing these densities, the project aims to:

- Link option market data to asset pricing theory.

- Quantify tail risk and shifts in investor sentiment around macroeconomic and geopolitical events.

- Provide forecasting tools for realized volatility, tail events, and risk premia.

## Core Contributions

### 1. Theoretical Foundations

Risk-Neutral Density (RND): Derived from option prices under the no-arbitrage framework.

Breeden-Litzenberger Theorem: The second derivative of the call price curve with respect to strike yields the RND.

Key Distinction: Risk-neutral vs. physical probability distributions, linked via the stochastic discount factor (pricing kernel).

### 2. Practical Extraction Techniques

- Interpolation & curve fitting of discrete option data.

- Numerical differentiation with regularization to address:

- Noise amplification

- Non-negativity violations

- Arbitrage constraints (monotonicity, convexity).

- Advanced smoothing methods (e.g., TV regularization, ADMM).

### 3. Informational Content of the RND

- Mean (1st moment): Market-expected Strike price

- Variance (2nd moment): Market-expected volatility.

- Skewness (3rd moment): Crash risk and downside fear.

- Kurtosis (4th moment): Jump probability and fat-tail risk.

uordere

* Risk Premia:

* Volatility Risk Premium (VRP)

* Skewness Risk Premium (SRP) — shown to predict excess returns and tail events.

### 4. Event-Driven Analysis

Novel focus: high-frequency RND dynamics around macroeconomic and geopolitical shocks.

Captures structural shifts in beliefs vs. risk aversion that aggregate measures like the VIX cannot detect.

Provides granular insights into how markets price uncertainty during critical announcements.

### 5. Applications

Forecasting:

Returns using SRP.

Realized volatility and jump risk using RND moments.

Pricing Tail-Sensitive Instruments: Digital options, variance swaps, etc.

Recovering Risk Aversion Functions: Empirical insights into the "pricing kernel puzzle" during stress events.
